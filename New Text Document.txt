My Take:
I wanted to review the Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range separately but I have used them simultaneously one after the other. I can't blame myself for that but I loved their previous range - Kalahari Melon. So, when I received the both ranges almost at the same time to test, I couldn; decide which one to go with and wait on other. So, I just used them both.
Please check about me section for my hair type. The products I use depend upon many factors like my mood, my hair's mood LOL.
So, when I have used the Hask Chia Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair was turned soft and super manageable like their previous range. But I didn't notice any volume in my hair. The super nice conditioning properties made my hair weighdown which is not what I was looking for in this range.
When I have used the Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range - the kit included shampoo,conditioner,deep conditioning mask and a cute hair brush. This smelled soo good and I loved how my hair smelled good even after like two days of shampooing. I personally loved the deep conditioning mask, I used it once a week and this made my hair feel super nice and deep conditioned.
The good things about both Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range 
The Chia seed Volumizing range is good in its way of making my hair look and feel nice but I don't see it is working on my fine thin hair. My hair lacks volume which was one of the major claims of this range. Apart from this, I see it smells nice, works well and good for everyday usage. 
The Superfruit Healthy range is amazing for the claims it made and I totally loved it. I have always loved the brand for their products so, no wonder I loved this one too. I repurchased the deep conditioning mask. The mask totally made me hair so moisturized during these colder months of the year. 
They both are super affordable
For the price you pay, you get a lot of product which lasts for atleast 2-3 months based on the usage.
Easily available, I usually get mine at the Walgreens but I see many other stores carry it too. 
Super chic packaging and loved the brush.
Things need to be improved Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range 
Except the fact that the chiaseed one needs to have a bit different consistency to stick to their claims, I do not have anything negative to say about these.
