My Take:
I have not used a neck cream before but I have always wanted to try one. I am not built thin but I am an average built. I blame my childhood for my necklines. I have got them when I was in my teenage. I put on a bit of weight and hormones played their part well in damaging my skin and body. 
I have massaged using oils last year when I was getting ready for my wedding in hopes of getting a nice looking neck. But even though I followed the ritual for more than 3 months, there were no results. So, I gave up.
Fast forward to 2016- 
I got a chance to try the NeoStrata SKIN ACTIVE Triple Firming Neck Cream. I received this product nearly 2 months back but I was very busy with my studies(I am a graduate student) that I couldn't focus on testing any new skincare products.
Once I'm done with my semester, that's when I started using the PR samples and new skincare/makeup bought by me over few months. Expect some more reviews this month before I reveal what I got for my birthday :)
Let me come to the point of why I am writing this blog post. I want to introduce a product that worked wonders for me and the product quantity is so huge that I see a lot of product left even after using it religiously for over a month and a half days.
I want to state something here, this product is no miracle that works overnight. One need to be super consistent with the usage and I have used it for over a month twice daily. I am not really a fan of my neck because of the too many necklines that actually covered up my neck, but for this post, I want to share mine before and after pictures. The change may not be super evident in pictures but I trust my eyes and I will try to update this blogpost with updated pictures in next month.
The good points
There was a visibly tighter effect as soon as I started using it
The cream is very moisturizing and has a very nice smell( I don't complain so much about scents usually until and unless the smell gives me a headache)
The cream comes in a pump dispenser which not only dispenses the amount required for each usage and also, very hygienic
My necklines seemed to be filled up in few usages

Things to improve
The cream doesn't work at once. It takes a longer time to show results.
Can be pricey for some, but I am sure it is better than many other chemical/cosmetic procedures.

Exuviance Performance Peel AP25

My Take:


When I want to share my skincare history, the chemical peels have entered my life in the end of 2014. I have started getting them as a monthly skincare routine. I got them from my dermatologist and I have never got a thought of doing my own peels. I have tried various kinds of peels with the combinations of Salicylic acid, Glycolic acid etc. So, I consider myself very familiar with the chemical peels. I loved the way the chemical peels brighten up my skin, exfoliate and clear acne scars. 
But when I moved to the US for my studies(I'm a graduate student) I never dared to get a chemical peel here as I am very new to the place and I heard that the chemical peels are way too costlier than India. Also, I didn't know a dermatologist here to think of even trying them out. I gave up the thought of getting the chemical peel done here but I was pleasantly surprised.
Exuviance generously offered me their Performance Peel samples to test and I was happy and at the same time, I was scared. I was scared of the side effects that the peel may give me. But I was excited to see how it's going to work in giving me brighter looking skin.
So, after jolting down all the pros and cons, I decided to give in and try the Exuviance Performance Peel. After carefully reading the ingredients list and confirming them to be safe, I have cleansed my skin and used the product.
The Exuviance Performance Peel comes in a  box with separate 12 peel pads and 12 neutralizer pads, to be used together which are to be used in the period of 6 weeks - twice a week. 
Since, my skin is not new to the peels, my skin didnt react in a weird way( the instructions says to monitor your skin when you have used the peel in case of any reaction)
