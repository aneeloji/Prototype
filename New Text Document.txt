My Take:
I wanted to review the Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range separately but I have used them simultaneously one after the other. I can't blame myself for that but I loved their previous range - Kalahari Melon. So, when I received the both ranges almost at the same time to test, I couldn; decide which one to go with and wait on other. So, I just used them both.
Please check about me section for my hair type. The products I use depend upon many factors like my mood, my hair's mood LOL.
So, when I have used the Hask Chia Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair was turned soft and super manageable like their previous range. But I didn't notice any volume in my hair. The super nice conditioning properties made my hair weighdown which is not what I was looking for in this range.
When I have used the Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range - the kit included shampoo,conditioner,deep conditioning mask and a cute hair brush. This smelled soo good and I loved how my hair smelled good even after like two days of shampooing. I personally loved the deep conditioning mask, I used it once a week and this made my hair feel super nice and deep conditioned.
The good things about both Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range 
The Chia seed Volumizing range is good in its way of making my hair look and feel nice but I don't see it is working on my fine thin hair. My hair lacks volume which was one of the major claims of this range. Apart from this, I see it smells nice, works well and good for everyday usage. 
The Superfruit Healthy range is amazing for the claims it made and I totally loved it. I have always loved the brand for their products so, no wonder I loved this one too. I repurchased the deep conditioning mask. The mask totally made me hair so moisturized during these colder months of the year. 
They both are super affordable
For the price you pay, you get a lot of product which lasts for atleast 2-3 months based on the usage.
Easily available, I usually get mine at the Walgreens but I see many other stores carry it too. 
Super chic packaging and loved the brush.
Things need to be improved Hask Chia Volumizing range and Hask Superfruit Healthy Hair range 
Except the fact that the chiaseed one needs to have a bit different consistency to stick to their claims, I do not have anything negative to say about these.

Primer
The Prime objective primer is one product that I was super excited to try out. I have super dry skin and I got a sun burn recently which took really a long time to settle down. I have only started using the product until recently.
I have huge pores and for me, primer is very important in my makeup routine. I can’t think of skipping it even if I’m planning to wear makeup for an hour or so. I have tried many primers and I know which primer suits my skin type. I have clear idea on what I need from a primer. 
The claims are
Did you notice the claims are pretty interesting, right? I was expecting some clear gel like consistency but I am pleasantly surprised. The product has a liquid-gel consistency has purple sheen to it. I was skeptic on applying it to my skin. It’s because I know purple cancels the imperfections in the skin tone but I have never tried color correcting my skin. 
Anyway, I decided to try it one evening and I was hoping not to ruin my makeup as it was a special day. The primer stood by its claims; it allowed me to paint my face the way I liked. I loved how smooth my skin has become and how radiant it looked even without the foundation. The primer itself was good enough to complete the look by finishing powder. That pretty much summarizes my experience with the product. 
I particularly loved the packaging of the product. It looked so royal when it was placed on my makeup desk. The glossy look added an extra touch of class to the packaging. The pump dispenser was perfect for letting out only the quantity we need and not waste the product. Adding to it, very tiny amount is needed to cover the entire face. Also, it is very hygienic. 
Overall, I loved the product and it can’t be ignored on the list of “Top Primers of 2017”

About the website:

My experience: 
I have signed up with the application through my IPhone. I haven't used their website as I use my IPhone more than my MacBook. The mobile application looked good to me. The design is easy to understand even for a beginner. When you sign up, you will have various options like Live Now, Browse categories, Reminders and Profile related Menu.
You have Account Info, Orders, Wallet Information, Referral details, Customer Support etc. You have a tutorial in case you are stuck somewhere. I signed up exclusively to experience the website/application workability and to find some amazing deals.  You can totally sign up as a seller too if you are interested in selling something. But, to do so, you will have to use their website. Through referral code, you can invite your friends and family by which you both get $10 each in order to spend on Tophatter. As I have mentioned earlier, Tophatter works based on bidding and direct sales. One has to bid for an item in order to buy it. Though you have an option of buying some products directly using "buy now", people prefer bidding as it may turn cheaper when you don't have enough buyers and also at times, you get the thrill of winning a competition. I personally prefer bidding. 
My take
As soon as I have signed up, I was given a welcome bonus of $10. I have got this opportunity to experience the website through Brandbacker and every blogger whose application has been approved by the brand were given two $10 coupons to buy something in exchange of honest opinion about the website. But there is a catch. Every $10 coupon needs to be used on a product worth more than $10; it could be $11 but yes, definitely greater than $10(product price + shipping). 
I was lucky to get my first deal at the price of $11, since I have the bonus; I had to pay just $1 and what I bought? – Bare Minerals face powder. Though the shade was a wrong choice, I can still use it to set my concealer. 
Trying to spend the other two coupons was a pain. As a beauty blogger I focused my interest on bidding for makeup. Every product whose price started off with $1 + $4 shipping can get really costly or end at $10. If it gets really costly, you can totally ignore it and bid for some other product. But if it ends at some price lesser than $10, the coupon code can’t be applied to the product and you are forced to pay the full money (be it just $10, you wanted to pay $2 thinking of the coupon right). This happened to me twice, so I have cancelled the order and after cancelling the order twice, my account was held up from bidding for a week.
